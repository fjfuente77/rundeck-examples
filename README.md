# Rundeck Deploys

## Overview

This repository gathers examples of Rundeck deployments in various configurations, aiming to assist those who need it. Each example is located in its own folder within the examples directory.

## General Considerations

Each example is self-contained, meaning it only applies to the context of what exists in that example's folder.

All examples can be extended and configured to meet the needs of the user.
